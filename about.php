						Indian industries are growing exponentially in variety of sectors. On the other hand, India excels in imparting higher education in management, engineering, medical sciences, basic sciences etc. thereby producing graduates at large scale every year. It is evident that the demand of manpower in the industry is able to cope up with the supply in terms of graduate students. Thus, the Ministry has taken the responsibility of co-ordination of all skill development efforts across the country, removal of disconnect between demand and supply of skilled manpower by building up the vocational and technical training framework. In turn, the skill up-gradation/ building of new skills, and innovative thinking among youth will help job providers to get the desired skilled manpower along with the job creators also. A ‘Skilled India’ mission bloomed on a large scale presently by involving high standards in education. Also, it is aided by its functional arms- National Skill Development Agency (NSDA), National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), National Skill Development Fund (NSDF) and 33 Sector Skill Councils (SSCs) along with 187 training partners registered with NSDC.

					<p>
						Deen Dayal Upadhyay Kaushal Kendra (DDU-KK) is one of the Schools of studies at DAVV, Indore and has been established by receiving funds from UGC New Delhi under the scheme of Skill Development. Basically, this school aims at providing Skill Based Education under National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF). It is well known fact that skills and knowledge are the vital driving forces for social development and economic growth of any country. In current scenario, it is evident that there is a huge gap in “demand from industry and supply of graduate skilled workforce”. To fulfill this gap, UGC has implemented the schemes such as Community Colleges, B.Voc Degree Programmes, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Centers for Knowledge Acquisition and Upgradation of Skilled Human Abilities and Livelihood (KAUSHAL). In present, all these schemes have been merged into a single scheme for providing Skill Based Education under National Qualification Framework.


						<br>
						<br>
						Unlike Traditional Education schemes, the courses run under Skilled Based Education schemes follow flexible, multiple entry and exit facilities to the learners. It enables the learners to seek employment after any level of award and join back whenever feasible to upgrade qualifications either to move higher in job profile or in higher educational system. After 10+2, a learner may enter in a specific sector skill, completing 30, 60, 120 and 180 cumulative credits in 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years thereby awarding Certificate, Diploma, Advanced Diploma and B.Voc Degree at NSQF level 4 to level 7 respectively. After completion of B.Voc degree, the learners may further move to PG Diploma, M.Voc Degree and Research Degree programme mapped at NSQF level 8 to 10 respectively in a specific sector.
						With the aforementioned Skilled Based Education Scheme, DDU-KK is privileged to run B.Voc (Landscape Design), B.Voc (Nutrition & Dietetics), B.Voc (Handicraft), Diploma in Logistics & Supply (Cargo Management) [at Community College], M.Voc (Interior Design) and B.Voc (Interior Design) and B.Voc (Fashion Technology) [running at DoLLL].
